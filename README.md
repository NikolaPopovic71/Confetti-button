# Confetti-button

- To create the confetti effect, the external library **`canvas-confetti`** was used.
- **`canvas-confetti`** library should be involved directly in HTML code

``` html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvas-confetti@1.4.0"></script>
```
> [!TIP]
> Ensure this is placed before your script.js so the library loads first.

- HTML code you can find here [index.html]()
